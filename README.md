# Oncha - A Modern Trading Assistant

I built Oncha to provide traders with a powerful set of tools to navigate the cryptocurrency markets more effectively. The goal is to help users make informed decisions by providing clear data and analysis, without the noise.

## The Problem

The crypto space can be overwhelming. Traders face challenges like:

- Information overload from various sources.
- The risk of "rug pulls" and other scams.
- Difficulty in tracking portfolio performance across different assets.

## The Solution: Oncha's Toolkit

I developed a suite of tools to address these challenges directly.

### Predictive Pulse

This tool helps with market analysis. It uses advanced algorithms to analyze chart patterns and market data to identify potential trading signals and insights. It's designed to help with:

- ✅ Real-time Analysis
- ✅ Smart Predictions
- ✅ Risk Management
- ✅ Portfolio Tracking

### Aegis Rug-Pull Shield

Security is crucial in crypto. The Aegis Shield is an early warning system designed to help users identify and avoid potential rug pulls. It automates checks for common red flags, including:

- ✅ Holder Distribution Analysis
- ✅ Smart Contract Veracity Checks
- ✅ Liquidity Status (Locked/Burned)

### The Vault

A comprehensive portfolio tracker that gives you a clear view of your investments. It offers:

- ✅ A unified dashboard for total portfolio value and PnL.
- ✅ Detailed breakdown of each token.
- ✅ Profit and loss tracking.
- ✅ Insights to help with risk analysis and identifying opportunities.

## How I Built It

I built Oncha using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The user interface components are from shadcn/ui and Magic UI.

During development, I used an AI assistant to help with some of the more repetitive tasks, like generating boilerplate code or providing autocompletion suggestions. This helped me focus more on the core logic and unique features of the application. The main architecture, component design, and core functionalities were all planned and coded by me.
